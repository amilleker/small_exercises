1) Given a sequence of numbers and an integer total, check if a contiguous sequence adds to the integer total.
Ex: integer_total = 10, sequence = [8, 1, 1, 4, 5, 7].
Answer is true because 1+4+5 = 10

2) Implement binary tree traversal without recursion
You can use a stack here.

3) Write a function that converts a given string into an integer. (This question is almost always asked)
Recommend looking up Atoi on leetcode and solving it.

2. Calculate the avg length of words in a sentence

Parse an ip address / Validate an IP Address. Multiple test cases given.  


[[A],[A,B],[A,C],[B,D],[C,A]] -- Find the alphabet with highest neighbors?

1. the ORDER BY command in SQL is automatically set in what format if you didn't set it? Ascending or Descending?
Answer: Ascending
2. When you want to delete or add a column of a table in a database, what command you will use?
Answer: ALTER
3. this question about about LEFT JOIN, they ask what command you want to use if you want to keep all the info of the left table?
Answer: left join
4. You want to combine two column after removing two duplicates, use UNION or UNION ALL?
Answer: UNION  
5. Top(3)

You have a 2-D array of friends like [[A,B],[A,C],[B,D],[B,C],[R,M], [S],[P], [A]]
Write a function that creates a dictionary of how many friends each person has. People can have 0 to many friends. However, there won't be repeat relationships like [A,B] and [B,A] and neither will there be more than 2 people in a relationship  

Avg length of words, some of the edge cases are having spaces in the beginning and end of the words, returning a float instead of int, returning None for blank input.
Valid ip address, edge case to remember is if there are alphanumeric characters.

Python graph node count  

SQL : Top 3 Products by sale, % using Case, Basic Having clause and one Set operator (Intersect) type question

Python : Average word length, ip-address parsing, dictionary, list of lists, flatten list of lists. ( Similar to previous interview experiences)  
Flatten a nested dictionary?? ( this was the hardest question in coder pad questions )  

Python: IP Address Binary Search, Facebook Friends Tree,  

1) Print Max element of a given list
2) Print median of a given list
3) Print the first nonrecurring element in a list
4) Print the most recurring element in a list
5) Greatest common Factor
