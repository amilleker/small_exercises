I want to be the very best,
Like no one ever was.
To catch them is my real test,
To train them is my cause.
I will travel across the land,
Searching far and wide.
Each Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside
It's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon!
You're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon
A heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
Pokemon
yeah
every challenge along the way
with courage i will face
i will battle everyday
to claim my rightful place
come with me the time is right
theres no better team
arm and arm wellâ€¦
